      <h1>LocoNet LNCV Programming Pane</h1>

      <p>The "Configure LNCV Modules" tool lets you access and program all connected
      LocoNet devices that respond to the (Uhlenbrock) LNCV protocol.<br>
        Examples are the Uhlenbrock xxx and Digikeijs DR5033 booster.
      You find the tool in the LocoNet menu as long as a LocoNet connection is available.</p>

      <p>As the tool is still under development, we advice to use it in combination with the "Show Raw Data"
        option in the <a href="../locomon/LocoMonFrame.shtml">LocoNet Monitor</a> to check for any additional
        responses rejected by the LNCV filters.</p>

      <p>Unless a session is running, LNCV modules will not respond to Read/Write commands (and the buttons are
        disabled).</p>

      <h2>Module LNCV Programming</h2>
      <p>LNCV Programming requires entry of an Article (model) number as provided in the manufacturer's
        documentation.<br>
        Enter the number eg. 5033 in the "Article" field before proceeding.<br>
      Also, enter the Module Address in the corresponding field.</p>

      <p>After opening a session, the "Open Module Programming" stays highlighted amd the Read and Write buttons are
        enabled. To close the programming of a module, click the same button, that now reads "Stop Module Programming"
        .</p>
      <p>Enter a CV number and click Read, or a CV number plus a new value to set in the CV, and click Write.</p>

      <p>LNCV Responses coming back from the layout will be listed in the table (under development).</p>

    <h2>Broadcast LNCV Programming</h2>
      <p>Click "Start Broadcast Programming" to start a session.</p>
      <p>To close a Broadcast session, click "Leave Broadcast Programming".</p>

      <p>Using the universal address 65535 you can, as the name suggests, call up all mobile station Adapters.
      As the universal address is not valid for addressing various mobile station adapters, it can only
      be used to call up an individual adapter for which the address is unknown.
      For this you connect the said adapter to the LocoNet. The adapter can then be called up and its address
        read from LNCV 0.</p>

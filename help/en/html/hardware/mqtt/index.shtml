      <h1>Hardware Support: MQTT</h1>
      <img src="images/mqtt-logo.png" alt="MQTT logo" align="center">
      
      <p><a href="https://mqtt.org" target="_blank">MQTT </a>is a "client-server publish-subscribe" protocol, meaning that JMRI connects
      to an MQTT server and subscribes to receive messages on certain topics.  JMRI also publishes messages to the MQTT server
      and any device subscribed to that topic will receive a copy.  This approach makes it relatively easy for the model railroader
      to use MQTT communication to develop any number of layout control and automation scenarios.
      </p>
      
      <p>Devices both on and off the layout can use the MQTT protocol to connect to JMRI. As of release 4.21.2, JMRI implements 
      MQTT-connected turnouts, sensors, and lights with additional object types expected in the future. For other objects and
      devices off the layout, you can use a provided <a href="#scripts"> script </a> or write your own using JMRI's MQTT Adapter
      object and methods.  You can use JMRI's MQTT capability to communicate with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things"
      target="_blank">IOT devices</a> as well as <a href="../arduino/index.shtml">arduinos</a> and other microcontrollers.

      <h2>Connecting to the MQTT Message Broker</h2>
      
      <p>
      Establish a connection to the MQTT message broker via the Connections pane in the <a href="../../package/apps/TabbedPreferences.shtml">
      Preferences window.</a> Select "MQTT" as the manufacturer name.  The "IP Address/Host Name" can be "localhost" if you are running an
      MQTT message broker on the same machine as JMRI, or the IP address or host name of an external server (see under <a href="#debug">Debugging</a>).
      </p>

      
      <p>
      Currently, JMRI can handle only one MQTT connection at a time. You can establish an MQTT connection at the same time as other
      connection types, but more than one MQTT connections will not work properly. This may be changed at some point if people find a 
      reason to need more than one MQTT connections.

      <h2>Layout Objects</h2>

         <a name= "limitations" id="limitations"></a>
         <h3>Available Objects</h3>
      
         <p>
         Older versions of JMRI (4.12 and earlier) only support Turnouts.  Sensors and Lights were added in 4.21.1.  Support for 
         Reporters is expected to be added in 4.22.  Support for Signal Masts is not scheduled.
         </p>
      
        <h3>Object Names</h3>

        <p>
        Layout objects such as turnouts, sensors, and lights must be identified to JMRI as being connected via MQTT. To identify such
        devices, JMRI objects are created with a <a href="../../doc/Technical/Names.shtml"> system name </a> prefix of "M" (this default
        prefix letter can be changed if desired on the connection preferences page).  The following character will be automatically assigned
        as "T", "S", or "L" as appropriate.  The remainder of the name does not have to follow any particular model.  For example, 
        JMRI MQTT Turnouts are specified with JMRI system names like "MTabcd" or :MT123".
        </p>

    <a name="topics" id="topics"></a>
    <h2>MQTT Topics</h2>
        
    <h3>Topics for Available Objects</h3>
    
    <p>
    <span class="since">Since JMRI 4.15.5</span>
    JMRI publishes and receives MQTT essages on specific "topics".  An MQTT topic is the label or headline for a message that is broadcast
    or subscribed to.  MQTT topics within JMRI are formed by concatenating the "MQTT channel," the object-specific MQTT topic for the type
    of object (different for publishing and subscribing), and the object's system name suffix.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Using the defaults in the JMRI Connection preferences pane <a href="images/MQTT_Preferences rel4-21-2.png">
    <img src="images/MQTT_Preferences rel4-21-2.png" alt="MQTT preferences" align="right" height="278" width="278">(shown in the picture to the right)</a>, the MQTT
    topic for a Turnout is constructed by concatenating "/trains/" with "track/turnout/" and the system name suffix.  For example, a JMRI Turnout
    with system name "MTabcd" will publish and subscribe to the topic "/trains/track/turnout/abcd". There are two parts to that: A base topic 
    common to everything JMRI does on that connection, and a type-specific topic specific to each type.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    You can change the "channel" or base topic by going to the JMRI Connection preferences, selecting your MQTT connection's preference pane,
    checking the "Additional Connection Settings" box, and then entering the desired value in the "MQTT channel" selection box.<br>
    You then must save your changes and restart JMRI; the program
    won't continue to operate normally after changing the base prefix
    until you restart it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Note that the default value of "/trains/" is the default for all JMRI instances.  If you use a public MQTT message broker (like the http://test.mosquitto.org 
    test server mentioned below) keeping that default prefix will show you traffic from every other JMRI instance anywhere in the world still using 
    the default channel and connected to that broker.  You should change the default channel, usually to something based on your own railroad name.
    Current guidance from the MQTT community is not to have a leading slash; it is present in the JMRI default for historical reasons.
    </p>
    
    <p>You can change the type-specific part of each topic string using the other fields in the preferences.  There are separate fields
    for specifying what JMRI should publish (the "send" field) and what JMRI should subscribe to (recognize back from the layout, the "receive" field).
    </p>

    <p>
    If you want the object's system name suffix to be in the topic string at some place other than at the end, you can use a "wild card" of "{0}"
    within the string to put the object's system name suffix at that place.  This allows you to set up topics like "track/turnout/{0}/state" and
    JMRI will generate "track/turnout/abc123/state" as the specific topic for turnout "MTabc123".
    </p>
    
    <p class="noted">
    Be sure to save the preferences if you have changed anything (hit the "Save" button on the Preferences list pane) and restart JMRI to put the
    changes into effect.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Should it be desirable to change the object-specific part of the prepended topic string as part of JMRI start-up, you can use a script as refereced
    <a href="#scripting">below.</a> 
    
    <h3>Custom Topics</h3>
    
    <p>
    It is possible to use the JMRI MQTT capability via scripting to send and receive messages on a topic of your own choosing (<a href="#scripts">see below</a>).
    These messages can further be used to trigger <a href="../../tools/Logix.shtml"> Logix,</a> populate <a href="../../tools/Memories.shtml">Memories</a> 
    and then displayed on panels, or whatever purposes you find useful.

   <a id="payload" name="payload"></a>
   <h2>Message Content</h2>
   
    <p>
    Message "payloads" for JMRI objects are typically single words that represent the state of the object.  It is also possible to replace the 
    standard message payloads by using a <a href="#scripts">custom version of the message parser</a> (including substituting 
    <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html" target="_blank">JSON messages</a>).
    </p>
 
        <h3>Turnouts</h3>
            By default, the message content (send and receive) for turnouts is "CLOSED" and "THROWN". Turnouts can also receive messages and be set to
            "INCONSISTENT" and "UNKNOWN".  Any other message will generate a Warning in the  <a href="../../../package/apps/SystemConsole.shtml">
            JMRI System Console</a> and will reset the turnout state to "UNKNOWN."
            
        <h3>Sensors</h3>
            <span class="since">Since JMRI 4.21.1</span>        
            By default, the message content for sensors is "ACTIVE" and "INACTIVE".  Sensors can also receive messages of and be set to "UNKNOWN". 
            Any other message will generate a Warning in the  <a href="../../../package/apps/SystemConsole.shtml">JMRI System Console</a> but will
            not change the Sensor state.            
            
        <h3>Lights</h3>
            <span class="since">Since JMRI 4.21.1</span>
            By default, the message content for sensors is "ON" and "OFF".  Any other messages will result in a Warning in the
            <a href="../../../package/apps/SystemConsole.shtml"> JMRI System Console.</a> but will not change the Sensor state.

    <a id="scripts" name="scripts"></a>
    <h2>Scripting</h2>
    
    <p>
    The JMRI MQTT capability is very general and can be used to send and receive arbitrary messages from any MQTT-aware device on or off the layout.
    In addition, scripts can b used to change standard message processing and default parameters.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    All the scripts discussed here can be found in <a href="../../../../../jython/MQTT/"> the JMRI distribution.</a>  More information about 
    scripting with JMRI is provided under <a href="../../tools/scripting/index.shtml"> Scripting</a> in the JMRI Help and web site.
    </p>

           <h4>Changing the Default Message Parsing</h4>
           <span class="since">Since JMRI 4.15.5</span>
        
            <p>
            You can use a script to install a new <a href="../../../../../JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/mqtt/MqttContentParser.html">MqttContentParser</a>
            object to code and decode the content of messages. You might want to use JSON format, or need to adapt to specific messages from 
            some already-existing devise; you can create a custom parser to do any of that. See the <a href="../../../../../jython/MQTT/SetMqttParser.py">
            SetMqttParser.py</a> sample script for how to do that. For a Java example, see the
            <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/blob/master/java/src/jmri/jmrix/mqtt/MqttTurnout.java#L41">inner
            class implementation in MqttTurnout</a>.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Note that you can call
            <code>setParser(...)</code>
            on the
            <a href="../../../../../JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/mqtt/MqttTurnoutManager.html">jmri.jmrix.mqtt.MqttTurnoutManager</a>
            or on an individual
            <a href="../../../../../JavaDoc/doc/jmri/jmrix/mqtt/MqttTurnout.html">jmri.jmrix.mqtt.MqttTurnout</a>
            object. If you call it on the MqttTurnoutManager, all <strong>later created</strong> MqttTurnout objects will use the new parser;
            earlier-created ones will not be changed.  This means you should execute a script to change the parser before loading any panel files
            if you want all MqttTurnouts to be modified.
            </p>

            <h4>Publishing Messages</h4>
            <p>
            The <a href="../../../../../jython/MQTT/SendMqttMessage.py">SendMqttMessage.py</a> is an example of how to send any message
            on any topic (automatically prefixed with JMRI MQTT channel) for processing by other devices.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Subscribing to (Receiving) Messages</h4>
            <p>
            You can use the <a href="../../../../../jython/MQTT/ReceiveMqttMessage.py">ReceiveMqttMessage.py</a> script to subscribe to any topic 
            off the JMRI MQTT channel (both for JMRI objects and custom) to receive message for further processing.  Standard 
            <a href="https://www.hivemq.com/blog/mqtt-essentials-part-5-mqtt-topics-best-practices/" target="_blank"> MQTT wildcards (# and +)</a>
            can be used (as of release 4.21.3).
            </p>
            
            <h4>Changing the MQTT Message Topic at JMRI Startup</h4>
            <span class="since">Since JMRI 4.15.5</span>
            <p>
            The sample script <a href="../../../../../jython/MQTT/SetMqttPrefix.py">SetMqttPrefix.py</a> shows how to set object-specific topic components
            at JMRI startup. Note that any changes should be made at startup time before creating any Turnout objects, i.e. the script must be
            run before any panel files are loaded. Changing the prefix only affects Turnouts that are created after the change.
            </p>
            
            
            <h4>Changing MQTT Default Parameters</h4>           
            <span class="since">Since JMRI 4.21.3</span>
            <p>
            Two parameters used in MQTT processing can be reset via scripts.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            <a href="https://mosquitto.org/man/mqtt-7.html" target="_blank">MQTT Quality of Service</a> indicates to the MQTT message broker how to h
            andle message delivery and receipt. Allowable values are 0, 1, and 2.  JMRI uses QoS level 1 (broker will deliver message at least once) by default.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            <a href="https://www.hivemq.com/blog/mqtt-essentials-part-8-retained-messages/" target="_blank">"Retained messages"</a> indicates to the 
            MQTT message broker whether to retain the last message received for a certain topic.  JMRI sends messages with the retain option on.  This
            allows any new subscriber to automatically receive the last message (often the state of a JMRI object) when it starts up.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Both of these parameters can be changed using the <a href="../../../../../jython/MQTT/SetMqttOptions.py">SetMqttOptions.py</a> script.           
            </p>

    If you don't have an MQTT system, and want to play with this connection type, 
    you can enter "test.mosquitto.org" for the host name
    to use a publicly-available (non-JMRI) test server. 
    For more information on this server, see the 
    <a href="http://test.mosquitto.org">test.mosquitto.org</a>
    web page.

    <p>
    If you install the 
    <a href="https://mosquitto.org/download/">mosquitto tools</a>
    on your machine,
    you can use a command like
<pre>
    mosquitto_sub -h test.mosquitto.org -v -t '/trains/#'
</pre>

    to subscribe and print JMRI turnout info as it's published. 
    To publish a change for JMRI to pick up:

<pre>
    mosquitto_pub -h test.mosquitto.org -t /trains/track/turnout/123 -r -m "CLOSED"
    mosquitto_pub -h test.mosquitto.org -t /trains/track/turnout/123 -r -m "THROWN"
</pre>

    These commands can be run on the same machine as JMRI, or on a separate machine.

   <p>
   There are also MQTT tools available for 
   <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=apple+app+store+mqtt&amp;oq=apple+app+store+mqtt">iOS devices</a> and 
   <a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=mqtt&amp;c=apps&amp;authuser">Android devices</a>
   that can be useful for monitoring, testing and operating your layout.

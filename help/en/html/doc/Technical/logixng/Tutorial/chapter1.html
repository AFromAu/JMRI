<h1>LogixNG Tutorial - Chapter 1</h1>

<h2>LogixNG - What is it?</h2>

LogixNG is similar to Logix. It's a way to define rules, like "If sensor IS1 is Active, then set turnout IT2 to
Thrown". It borrows some concepts from Logix, but it's a complete new design and it can work side by side with
Logix.
<p>
<h2>Setting up a LogixNG and a ConditionalNG</h2>

First, we create a LogixNG. We start <b>PanelPro</b> and select <b>Tools</b> &rArr; <b>Tables</b> &rArr; <b>LogixNG</b>
&rArr; <b>LogixNG</b> to open the table with LogixNGs. Click button <b>Add...</b> to add a new LogixNG. By default, the
checkbox <b>Automatically generate System Name</b> is checked for all items in LogixNG. Click the button <b>Create</b>
to create a LogixNG.

<p>

Create a ConditionalNG

Then we create a ConditionalNG. Click button <b>New ConditionalNG</b> to add a new ConditionalNG. Click the button
<b>Create</b> to create it.

<p>


All actions and expressions in LogixNG are named beans, which means that they have system names and user names. But
it's recommended to only use auto system names and no user names for actions and expressions. Therefore, system names
and user names of actions and expressions are not visible by default. If you want to specify the system names and/or
user names, you can turn on the setting "Show system names and user names" in the LogixNG preferences.
<p>
The most important reason to not use system names and user names for actions and expressions is that it makes it much
easier to copy things. Currently, when a copy is made of actions and/or expressions, the copies get auto names and no
user names. It would be possible to add support for the user to specify system names and/or user names when doing a
copy, but since actions and expressions build a tree, a copy can be of many actions and/or expressions at once.





<h2>1. Basics</h2>

Create a LogixNG
Create a ConditionalNG

Create an action: ActionTurnout

Remove the action and add the action IfThenElse.
Add ExpressionSensor and ActionTurnout

Lets add a new IfThenAction with a ExpressionSensor and a ActionTurnout. To do this, we need to add the action
Many. We can do this by cutting the IfThenElse expression so it's moved to the clip board, then add the Many
action and then paste the IfThenElse action back.


Cut the IfThenElse action, add a Many action and paste the IfThenElse action.





<h2>Using the clipboard</h2>

While editing a ConditionalNG, it can be useful to cut out something and leave it, editing something else, and then
paste it back. For this purpose, LogixNG has a clipboard. Each time you cut an action or expression, it is moved to the
clipboard.
<p>
The clipboard editor works the same way as the ConditionalNG editor, with the exceptions that actions and expressions
are never active while on the clipboard.
<p>
When an action or expression is cut, it will always be put on the first row in the clipboard. This is true even when
you cut an item on the clipboard itself. If you cut an item on the clipboard, that item will be removed from its
current place in the tree and moved to the first row in the tree.
<p>
Note that you can cut an item on any level in the clipboard tree. While editing a ConditionalNG, you may cut a big tree
from the ConditionalNG and you then wants to take only a small sub tree and paste back to the ConditionalNG.
<p>
Example:
* Many
  * IfThenElse
    * If sensor
	* Throw turnout
<p>
You can cut the Many action from the ConditionalNG, then go to the clipboard and expand the Many action and then cut
the IfThenElse action. The IfThenElse action will then be moved to the first row on the clipboard. Now you can go back
to the ConditionalNG and paste the IfThenElse action to the ConditionalNG.
<p>
You can also use the clipbord to move items from one ConditionalNG to another.
<p>
If the popup menu is opened on an item that can be copied, the menu item Copy is enabled. If "Copy" is selected, the
item and its sub tree are copied to the clipboard. Each item gets an auto system name and no user name.



<h2>Stop the power during lunch</h2>

Logix support reading the fast clock. LogixNG also supports reading the system clock. Lets assume you want to cut power
to the layout during the lunch. This can easily be done by the following ConditionalNG:

* IfThenElse
  * If: And
    * E1: Clock: System clock between 12.00 and 13.00
	* E2: Power: Is power ON?
  * Then: Power: Turn power off
  * Else:

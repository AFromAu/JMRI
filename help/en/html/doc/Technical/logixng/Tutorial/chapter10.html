<h1>LogixNG Tutorial - Chapter 10</h1>

<h2>Tables - working with templates</h2>

The panel "Chapter 10 - Tables" has four yards:
<ul>
<li>North yard</li>
<li>West yard</li>
<li>East yard</li>
<li>South yard</li>
</ul>

The first three yards are identical and the forth yard has an extra siding. Each track has a sensor that detects if the
track is occupied or not and each turnout has a signal mast. The rules for these yards are:

<ul>
<li>If the track that the turnout is pointing to is occupied, the mast should show "Stop".</li>
<li>If the track that the turnout is pointing to is the main line, the mast should show "Slow Clear".</li>
<li>If the track that the turnout is pointing to is not the main line, the mast should show "Slow Approach".</li>
</ul>
(These examples may not be prototypical, but the purpose is to show how to setup the rules in LogixNG).

<p>

<h2>How to create one ConditionalNG that controls all four yards?</h2>

First we need to give the named beans on the template yard unique names. In this example, we have these names for the
named beans in the template yard:
<ul>
<li>Left turnout</li>
<li>Middle turnout (only used for the South yard)</li>
<li>Right turnout</li>
<li>Left mast</li>
<li>Middle mast (only used for the South yard)</li>
<li>Right mast</li>
<li>Occupancy sensor</li>
</ul>

LogixNG has support for CSV tables, comma separated tables. These files are created by a spreadsheet software, for
example Open Office or MicroSoft Excel, and then exported to CSV files. A csv file can contains a table of the yards
and their named beans. For example, you can let each column represent each yard and let each row represent each named
bean.

<h1>LogixNG Tutorial - Chapter 23</h1>

<h2>Using LogixNG in other parts of JMRI or by third party software</h2>

LogixNG has a reserved group of system names for items created by other parts of JMRI. IQDA:JMRI:aaaa. The purpose of
these special system names is to guarantee that there will never be any collission between JMRI system names and system
names created by the user.
<p>
LogixNG has a reserved group of system names for items created by third party software that uses JMRI as a library.
IQDA:JMRI-LIB:aaaa. The purpose of
these special system names is to guarantee that there will never be any collission between the third party software
system names and system names created by the user or by JMRI.
<p>
The user can, but should not, create their own system names using IQDA:JMRI:aaaa or IQDA:JMRI-LIB:aaaa system names. By
doing so, the user takes the risk of collissions with JMRI or third party software. But for developers, this may be
useful during development.
<p>
While developing a tool for JMRI, you may end up with the need to create some special action or expression for LogixNG
to be used only in your tool. You can do that by developing the tool, but not announce its existence. LogixNG will
still be happy to use the new action or expression, but the user will not be able to add that action or expression
anywhere else in his ConditionalNGs. Note that people may argue about whenether this is good or bad, but it's at least
possible.

<h1>LogixNG Preview - Chapter 99</h1>

<h2>Note to reviewers of JMRI. When to merge LogixNG?</h2>

LogixNG is a huge PR. Around 700 files, where most of them are new. 




<h2>Version numbers</h2>

LogixNG has been developed for the last two years. Once consequence is that there are version numbers for older
versions of JMRI that needs to be changed once it's time to release LogixNG. The ones I'm aware of now is:

<ul>
<li>help/en/releasenotes/current-draft-note.shtml</li>
<li>xml/schema/layout-4-19-2.xsd</li>
<li>xml/schema/logixng/... - the schema files has version numbers and all of these needs to be changed.</li>
</ul>



<h2>File structure</h2>





<h2>Tests</h2>

There is not enough tests of LogixNG to be satisfied, but much of the code base are tested. LogixNG has the benefit
of having a huge amount of small classes, there most of the classes is quite easy to test. On the other hand, due to
the size of LogixNG, there is a huge amount of code that needs to be written to test LogixNG throughout.

<h1>LogixNG Preview - Chapter 1</h1>

<h2>LogixNG - What is it?</h2>

LogixNG is similar to Logix. It's a way to define rules, like "If sensor IS1 is Active, then set turnout IT2 to
Thrown". It borrows some concepts from Logix, but it's a complete new design and it can work side by side with
Logix.
<p>
<h2>Setting up a LogixNG and a ConditionalNG</h2>

First, we create a LogixNG. We start <b>PanelPro</b> and select <b>Tools</b> &rArr; <b>Tables</b> &rArr; <b>LogixNG</b>
&rArr; <b>LogixNG</b> to open the table with LogixNGs. Click button <b>Add...</b> to add a new LogixNG. By default, the
checkbox <b>Automatically generate System Name</b> is checked for all items in LogixNG and it's recommended to keep it
that way. Click the button <b>Create</b> to create a LogixNG.

<p>

Create a ConditionalNG

Then we create a ConditionalNG. Click button <b>New ConditionalNG</b> to add a new ConditionalNG. Click the button
<b>Create</b> to create it.

<p>





<h2>1. Basics</h2>

Create a LogixNG
Create a ConditionalNG

Create an action: ActionTurnout

Remove the action and add the action IfThenElse.
Add ExpressionSensor and ActionTurnout

Lets add a new IfThenAction with a ExpressionSensor and a ActionTurnout. To do this, we need to add the action
Many. We can do this by cutting the IfThenElse expression so it's moved to the clip board, then add the Many
action and then paste the IfThenElse action back.


Cut the IfThenElse action, add a Many action and paste the IfThenElse action.





<h2>Using the clipboard</h2>

While editing a ConditionalNG, it can be useful to cut out something and leave it, editing something else, and then
paste it back. For this purpose, LogixNG has a clipboard. Each time you cut an action or expression, it is moved to the
clipboard.
<p>
The clipboard editor works the same way as the ConditionalNG editor, with the exceptions that actions and expressions
are never active while on the clipboard.
<p>
When an action or expression is cut, it will always be put on the first row in the clipboard. This is true even when
you cut an item on the clipboard itself. If you cut an item on the clipboard, that item will be removed from its
current place in the tree and moved to the first row in the tree.
<p>
Note that you can cut an item on any level in the clipboard tree. While editing a ConditionalNG, you may cut a big tree
from the ConditionalNG and you then wants to take only a small sub tree and paste back to the ConditionalNG.
<p>
Example:
* Many
  * IfThenElse
    * If sensor
	* Throw turnout
<p>
You can cut the Many action from the ConditionalNG, then go to the clipboard and expand the Many action and then cut
the IfThenElse action. The IfThenElse action will then be moved to the first row on the clipboard. Now you can go back
to the ConditionalNG and paste the IfThenElse action to the ConditionalNG.
<p>
You can also use the clipbord to move items from one ConditionalNG to another.




<h3>Copy</h3>

If the popup menu is opened on an item that can be copied, the menu item Copy is enabled. If "Copy" is selected, the
item and its sub tree are copied to the clipboard. For each item, an auto system name is given, and if an item has a
user name, a new user name is given. The new user name is dependent on the current selected language, but for English
the new user name is "Copy of NNN" or "Copy # of NNN", there NNN is the original user name and # is an integer number
to get an unique user name.
<p>
If at least one of the items in the sub tree of the item has either a system name that's not an auto system name or has
a user name that is not empty, the menu item "Copy manually" is also enabled. If "Copy manually" is selected, a dialog
box will be shown with a table there the user may enter new system names and/or user names for the items to copy.





<h3>------------------- Remove this ---------- Why is Copy disabled? It's not implemented yet.</h3>

The ability to make a copy of actions and expressions is important. But it's also a more complicated operation than
cut and paste. When an item is cut and pasted, it's only moved from place A to place B. But if an item (or a sub tree)
is copied, it gets more complicated.
<p>
Each action and expression has a system name that must be unique. And the actions and expressions may have a user name
that also needs to be unique. How should this be done? The best answer is probably to give the user some options, for
example to let LogixNG create new automatic system names, or to give the user a table there he can enter new system
names for each item to copy. This needs some careful thinking and then someone has to implement it. Until then, Copy
is disabled.

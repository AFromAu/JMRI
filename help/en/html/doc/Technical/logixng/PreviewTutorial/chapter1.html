<h1>LogixNG Preview - Chapter 1</h1>

<h2>LogixNG - What is it?</h2>

LogixNG is similar to Logix. It's a way to define rules, like "If sensor IS1 is Active, then set turnout IT2 to
Thrown". It borrows some concepts from Logix, but it's a complete new design and it can work side by side with
Logix.
<p>
<h2>Setting up a LogixNG and a ConditionalNG</h2>

First, we create a LogixNG. We start <b>PanelPro</b> and select <b>Tools</b> &rArr; <b>Tables</b> &rArr; <b>LogixNG</b>
&rArr; <b>LogixNG</b> to open the table with LogixNGs. Click button <b>Add...</b> to add a new LogixNG. By default, the
checkbox <b>Automatically generate System Name</b> is checked for all items in LogixNG and it's recommended to keep it
that way. Click the button <b>Create</b> to create a LogixNG.

<p>

Create a ConditionalNG

Then we create a ConditionalNG. Click button <b>New ConditionalNG</b> to add a new ConditionalNG. Click the button
<b>Create</b> to create it.

<h2>1. Basics</h2>

Create a LogixNG
Create a ConditionalNG

Create an action: ActionTurnout

Remove the action and add the action IfThenElse.
Add ExpressionSensor and ActionTurnout

Lets add a new IfThenAction with a ExpressionSensor and a ActionTurnout. To do this, we need to add the action
Many. We can do this by cutting the IfThenElse expression so it's moved to the clip board, then add the Many
action and then paste the IfThenElse action back.


Cut the IfThenElse action, add a Many action and paste the IfThenElse action.

<h2>LogixNG Preview Tutorial</h2>

This tutorial has an <a href="#">example profile</a>.

<p>

Menu choice "... / LogixNG" has three tables:
<ul>
<li>LogixNG</li>
<li>LogixNG Modules</li>
<li>LogixNG Tables</li>
</ul>

Open the LogixNG tables. The other two, "LogixNG Modules" and "LogixNG Tables", are described later in this tutorial.
<p>
Select "Edit" for a ConditionalNG to open the ConditionalNG editor.
<p>
A ConditionalNG is a tree of actions and expressions, there some actions and some expressions can have children.
<p>
The editor doesn't know anything about actions nor expressions. Instead, the editor knows about female sockets and
male sockets. The female sockets is the exclamation marks and the question marks, followed by a name, for example "A4".
The name can be any number of letters and digits, starting with a letter.
<p>
The user never sees the male sockets, but each action and expression is encapsulated in a male socket.
<p>
Each ConditionalNG may have a memo there the user may enter some text, for example a description of the ConditionalNG.
Each ConditionalNGs in the example profile has a memo that describes that ConditionalNG.

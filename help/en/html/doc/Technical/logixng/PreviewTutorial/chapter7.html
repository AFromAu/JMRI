<h1>LogixNG Preview - Chapter 8</h1>

<h2>Sequence - controlling a crane and a loco</h2>

A layout for exhibitions has a coal storage with a coal crane, there the crane loads coal on a wagon which then
transports the coal to a harbour and drops the coal into a ship.

At first, we try to run the layout manually to see how it works.


IS_7_1 - Start layout
IS_7_1 - Stop layout
IS_7_1 - Reset layout

IM_1 - Crane angle left - right, commanded position
IM_2 - Crane angle left - right, actual position
IM_3 - Crane bucket up - down, commanded position
IM_4 - Crane bucket up - down, actual position
IM_5 - Crane bucket closed - open, commanded position
IM_6 - Crane bucket closed - open, actual position

Throttle 21 - Controls the steam engine



<h3>Some things to note:</h3>

The crane will not rotate left-right unless the bucket is in its top position. So if the crane doesn't rotate, make
sure that the bucket is lifted to its upmost position.
<p>
The bucket will not be loaded unless the bucket is opened, moved down to the bottom position and then closed.
<p>
The car will not be loaded unless the bucket of the crane is filled and opened above the car.





<h2>Now, lets automate this layout using LogixNG.</h2>



<p>
One problem remains. When we run the automation, the crane will always dig coal from the same spot. It will result in
that the coal on that spot runs out, while there is plenty of coal close to that spot. To fix this, we want the crane
to pick a random spot within an interval and dig at that random spot. To do this, we use the expression Formula and the
function random(). The function random() can take zero arguments and then returns a floating point number between 0 and
1, and it can take two arguments and then returns a floating point number between the first argument and the second
argument. We will use the later and give random() two arguments, there the first argument is the minimum value and the
second argument is the maximum value.

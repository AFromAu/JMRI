<h1>LogixNG Preview - Chapter 8</h1>

<h2>Sequence - controlling a crane and a loco</h2>

A layout for exhibitions has a coal storage with a coal crane, there the crane loads coal on a wagon which then
transports the coal to a harbour and drops the coal into a ship.

At first, we try to run the layout manually to see how it works.


IS_7_1 - Start layout
IS_7_1 - Stop layout
IS_7_1 - Reset layout

IM_1 - Crane angle left - right, commanded position
IM_2 - Crane angle left - right, actual position
IM_3 - Crane bucket up - down, commanded position
IM_4 - Crane bucket up - down, actual position
IM_5 - Crane bucket closed - open, commanded position
IM_6 - Crane bucket closed - open, actual position

Throttle 21 - Controls the steam engine



<h3>Some things to note:</h3>

The crane will not rotate left-right unless the bucket is in its top position. So if the crane doesn't rotate, make
sure that the bucket is lifted to its upmost position.
<p>
The bucket will not be loaded unless the bucket is opened, moved down to the bottom position and then closed.
<p>
The car will not be loaded unless the bucket of the crane is filled and opened above the car.





<h2>Now, lets automate this layout using LogixNG.</h2>

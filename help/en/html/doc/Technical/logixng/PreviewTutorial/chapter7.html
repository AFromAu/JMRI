<h2>Local variables</h2>



<p>
<h2>Order of local variables</h2>

The order of the local variables that are defined in an action or expression matters if you use one variable in the
initialization of another. Lets say you define two variables "a" and "b", and that you define "a" to be initialized to
the formula "34 * 4" and you define "b" to be initialized to "a * 3". This will work if "a" is defined before "b". You
can define both variables in the same action or expression, but "a" needs to be before "b" since "b" uses "a" in its
initialization.

<h2>Local variables are local</h2>

This may seem obvious, but when writing scripts that uses local variables, it's important to remember this. A script
can access the symbol table, but the symbol table is dependent on which action or expression that's currently running.

<h2>Local variables are NOT thread safe</h2>

Never use local variables on any other thread than the GUI thread.

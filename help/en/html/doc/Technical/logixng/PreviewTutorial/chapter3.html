<h2>IfThenElse</h2>

<h2>And</h2>

In Logix, the user can select between three different ways to combine the variables in the Conditional. And, Or and
Antecedent. 

<h2>Logix</h2>

LogixNG has an action called Logix that emulates how JMRI Logix works. The action Logix has one expression and a number
of boolean actions. A boolean action is an action that takes a boolean value (true/false) and then decides what to do.
The action Logix was added mainly to support import of JMRI Logix to LogixNG.
